# Placement_Analysis
This app provides an interactive interface for analyzing and visualizing data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
Further, the app also provides a platform where we can see based on attributes if the candidate will be placed or not
## Introduction

Data analysis is an essential part of modern decision-making processes. With the proliferation of data in various domains, having tools to explore, visualize, and understand data is crucial. This Streamlit app aims to simplify the data analysis process by providing a user-friendly interface to perform common data analysis tasks.

## Features

- Load and explore datasets
- Perform data preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Visualize data using various plots (e.g., scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps)
- Train and evaluate machine learning models
- And check for the chance of the candidate being placed
